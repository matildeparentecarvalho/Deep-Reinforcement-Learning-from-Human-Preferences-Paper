## Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences
Academic project developed at TH Köln (for the course Advanced Machine Learning) based on the paper "Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences"
(Christiano et al., NeurIPS 2017).

### Project Overview
This project analyzes an alternative reinforcement learning framework where reward functions are not explicitly defined, but instead learned from human
preference comparisons between short trajectory segments. The approach replaces manual reward engineering with a learned neural reward
model trained via supervised learning on human feedback, which is then optimized using standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
